![](../images/books/sapiens.jpg){: style="float: left"}

This book presents a brief history of humans, beginning from 2.5 million years ago when humans evolved, to the 21st century. Answering questions like: How was the life of hunter-gatherers for thousands of years before agricultural revolution? What is the impact of empires, religions and money in shaping the world? Why did the European empires dominate the modern period inspite of having many more powerful empires all across the world? How accepting ignorance has paved way for scientific revolution changing the way of our lives forever? One of the best books to delve deeply and understanding human nature.
